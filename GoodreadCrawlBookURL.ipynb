coastal town of Spunes, Oregon (not to be confused with Forks, Washington) her entire life. She's learned to love her small world, with the misfit animals on her hobby farm, and her friendships with the town’s inhabitants. But when her 5-year relationship ends and her ex, town-golden-boy Ian, suddenly gets engaged, Sage needs a win―something that will convince everyone to stop pitying her all the time, and to put Ian in his place. The Festival of Spunes, the town’s annual summer competition, would be the perfect opportunity. She just needs a partner.<br /><br />Fisher Lange was a hotshot chef in New York City until the loss of his sister left him numb, grieving, and responsible for his teenage niece Indy. When Fisher loses his Michelin star along with his love of cooking, his boss sends him and Indy to Spunes on a much-needed summer sabbatical to consult on a restaurant opening.

In this island paradise, Prospera\\'s lucky citizens enjoy long, fulfilling lives until the monitors embedded in their forearms, meant to measure their physical health and psychological well-being, fall below 10 percent.

Dana is drawn back repeatedly through time to the slave quarters, and each time the stay grows longer, more arduous, and more dangerous until it is uncertain whether or not Dana's life will end, long before it has a chance to begin.<br /><br />This young adult edition includes a new foreword by Tomi Adeyemi, <i>New York Times bestseller and Hugo and Nebula award winning author of fantasy titles <i>Children of Blood and Bone</i> and <i>Children of Virtue and Vengeance</i>.

Dana not only experiences the cruelties of slavery on her skin but also grimly learns to accept it as a condition of her own existence in the present. “Where stories about American slavery are often gratuitous, reducing its horror to explicit violence and brutality, Kindred is controlled and precise” (<i>New York Times</i>).<br /><br />“Reading Octavia Butler taught me to dream big, and I think it’s absolutely necessary that everybody have that freedom and that willingness to dream.” <br />—N.

Luckily, she finds courage at the bottom of a liquor bottle. When she drinks, she’s bold, funny, and unstoppable—and the Serenas love it. But as pledging intensifies, so does Blake’s drinking, until it’s seeping into every corner of her life. Ella assures Blake that she’s <i>fine</i>; partying hard is what it takes to make the cut.<br /><br />But success has never felt so much like drowning. With her future hanging in the balance and her past dragging her down, Blake must decide how far she’s willing to go to achieve her glittering dreams of success—and how much of herself she’s willing to lose in the process.', 'title': 'Thirsty', 'titleComplete': 'Thirsty', 'webUrl': 'https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/180725527-thirsty', '__typename': 'Book', 'viewerShelving': None, 'primaryContributorEdge': {'node': {'id': 'kca://author/amzn1.gr.author.v3.oC3858Tp-mowUBTK', 'name': 'Jas Hammonds', 'webUrl': 'https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/21109619.Jas_Hammonds', 'isGrAuthor': True, '__typename': 'Contributor'}, 'role': 'Author', '__typename': 'BookContributorEdge'}, 'secondaryContributorEdges': [], 'work': {'stats': {'ratingsCount': 58, 'textReviewsCount': 25, 'averageRating': 4.38, '__typename': 'BookOrWorkStats'}, 'id': 'kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v3.--Hkj69gEDpqw5HN', 'viewerShelvings': None, '__typename': 'Work', 'editions': {'webUrl': 'https://www.goodreads.com/work/editions/185772925', '__typename': 'BooksConnection'}, 'viewerShelvingsUrl': '/review/user_works/185772925'}, 'reviewEditUrl': 'https://www.goodreads.com/review/edit/180725527'}, '__typename': 'TopListBookEdge'}, {'rank': 64, 'count': 15437, 'node': {'id': 'kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v3.aW07qa1MjBQcNr6i', 'legacyId': 196774347, 'imageUrl': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1706544152i/196774347.jpg', 'description': 'An emotional, slow-burn, grumpy/sunshine, queer mid-century romance for fans of <i>Evvie Drake Starts Over</i>, about grief and found family, between the new star shortstop stuck in a batting slump and the reporter assigned to (reluctantly) cover his first season—set in the same universe as <i>We Could Be So Good</i>.<br /><br />The 1960 baseball season is shaping up to be the worst year of Eddie O’Leary’s life. He can’t manage to hit the ball, his new teammates hate him, he’s living out of a suitcase, and he’s homesick. When the team’s owner orders him to give a bunch of interviews to some snobby reporter, he’s ready to call it quits. He can barely manage to behave himself for the length of a game, let alone an entire season. But he’s already on thin ice, so he has no choice but to agree.<br /><br />Mark Bailey is not a sports reporter. He writes for the arts page, and these days he’s barely even managing to do that much. He’s had a rough year and just wants to be left alone in his too-empty apartment, mourning a partner he’d never been able to be public about. The last thing he needs is to spend a season writing about New York’s obnoxious new shortstop in a stunt to get the struggling newspaper more readers.<br /><br />Isolated together within the crush of an anonymous city, these two lonely souls orbit each other as they slowly give in to the inevitable gravity of their attraction. But Mark has vowed that he’ll never be someone’s secret ever again, and Eddie can’t be out as a professional athlete. It’s just them against the world, and they’ll both have to decide if that’s enough.', 'title': 'You Should Be So Lucky', 'titleComplete': 'You Should Be So Lucky', 'webUrl': 'https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/196774347-you-should-be-so-lucky', '__typename': 'Book', 'viewerShelving': None, 'primaryContributorEdge': {'node': {'id': 'kca://author/amzn1.gr.author.v1.cKbQczrptnnxQlvaXM9Cmg', 'name': 'Cat Sebastian', 'webUrl': 'https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/15171247.Cat_Sebastian', 'isGrAuthor': True, '__typename': 'Contributor'}, 'role': 'Author', '__typename': 'BookContributorEdge'}, 'secondaryContributorEdges': [], 'work': {'stats': {'ratingsCount': 452, 'textReviewsCount': 343, 'averageRating': 4.63, '__typename': 'BookOrWorkStats'}, 'id': 'kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v3.DFGYPT3cebPyW_xl', 'viewerShelvings': None, '__typename': 'Work', 'editions': {'webUrl': 'https://www.goodreads.com/work/editions/199054639', '__typename': 'BooksConnection'}, 'viewerShelvingsUrl': '/review/user_works/199054639'}, 'reviewEditUrl': 'https://www.goodreads.com/review/edit/196774347'}, '__typename': 'TopListBookEdge'}, {'rank': 65, 'count': 15078, 'node': {'id': 'kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v3.xTUQB4rjkLErb9bB', 'legacyId': 197522435, 'imageUrl': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1705519977i/197522435.jpg', 'description': 'In a grown-up twist on The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants , USA Today bestselling author Annie Rains pens a powerful, uplifting story of female friendship and resilience in a small Southern town, as former childhood friends overcome grief and begin to take new chances in their lives… with the help of a long-lost gift they were meant to share.

A young woman living with her father and her sister (to whom she has reluctantly but devotedly become a mother following the death of their own mother years prior), Manod can't shake her welling desire to explore life beyond the beautiful yet blisteringly harsh islands that her hardscrabble family has called home for generations.<br /><br />The arrival of two English ethnographers who hope to study the island culture, then, feels like a boon to her—both a glimpse of life outside her community and a means of escape. The longer the ethnographers stay, the more she feels herself pulled towards them, reckoning with a sensual awakening inside herself, despite her misgivings that her community is being misconstrued and exoticized.<br /><br />With shimmering prose tempered by sharp wit, Whale Fall tells the story of what happens when one person's ambitions threaten the fabric of a community, and what can happen when they are realized.

When even that livelihood is threatened, Tucia is left with one option—to join a wily, charismatic showman named Huey and become part of his traveling medicine show.<br /><br />Her medical license lends the show a pretense of credibility, but the cures and tonics Tucia is forced to peddle are little more than purgatives and bathwater.

It is the spring of 1976 and Eilis, now in her forties with two teenage children, has no one to rely on in this still-new country. Though her ties to Ireland remain stronger than those that hold her to her new land and home, she has not returned in decades.<br /><br />One day, when Tony is at his job and Eilis is in her home office doing her accounting, an Irishman comes to the door asking for her by name. He tells her that his wife is pregnant with Tony’s child and that when the baby is born, he will not raise it but instead deposit it on Eilis’s doorstep. It is what Eilis does—and what she refuses to do—in response to this stunning news that makes Tóibín’s novel so riveting.<br /><br />Long Island is about longings unfulfilled, even unrecognized. The silences in Eilis’ life are thunderous and dangerous, and there’s no one more deft than Tóibín at giving them language. This is a gorgeous story of a woman alone in a marriage and the deepest bonds she rekindles on her return to the place and people she left behind, to ways of living and loving she thought she’d lost.', 'title': 'Long Island', 'titleComplete': 'Long Island (Eilis Lacey, #2)', 'webUrl': 'https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/199798868-long-island', '__typename': 'Book', 'viewerShelving': None, 'primaryContributorEdge': {'node': {'id': 'kca://author/amzn1.gr.author.v1.HaaDwTIq1lBuSkZRA2nHIA', 'name': 'Colm Tóibín', 'webUrl': 'https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1351903.Colm_T_ib_n', 'isGrAuthor': False, '__typename': 'Contributor'}, 'role': 'Author', '__typename': 'BookContributorEdge'}, 'secondaryContributorEdges': [], 'work': {'stats': {'ratingsCount': 208, 'textReviewsCount': 78, 'averageRating': 4.02, '__typename': 'BookOrWorkStats'}, 'id': 'kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v3.JACtuL5F9CgD9cAj', 'viewerShelvings': None, '__typename': 'Work', 'editions': {'webUrl': 'https://www.goodreads.com/work/editions/145051364', '__typename': 'BooksConnection'}, 'viewerShelvingsUrl': '/review/user_works/145051364'}, 'reviewEditUrl': 'https://www.goodreads.com/review/edit/199798868'}, '__typename': 'TopListBookEdge'}, {'rank': 94, 'count': 12546, 'node': {'id': 'kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v3.FR6YbJNX6PtJk3WI', 'legacyId': 202399005, 'imageUrl': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1705022271i/202399005.jpg', 'description': '<b>\"A man is going to treat you how you treat yourself.

Her latest play, the only female-authored play on the London stage that season, has opened in the West End to rapturous applause from the audience.

There she finds a vibrant movie making scene filled with rising stars, acclaimed directors, and famous actors in a country that is torn between its past and its potentially bright future, between the liberation of the post-war cinema and the restrictions of the Catholic Church that permeates the very soul of Italy.<br /><br />As Vivien tries to forge a new future for herself, she also must face the long-buried truth of the recent World War and the mystery of what really happened to her deceased fiancé. <i>Every Time We Say Goodbye</i> is a brilliant exploration of trauma and tragedy, hope and renewal, filled with dazzling characters both real and imaginary, from the incomparable author who charmed the world with her novels <i>The Jane Austen Society</i> and <i>Bloomsbury Girls</i>.</b>\", 'title': 'Every Time We Say Goodbye', 'titleComplete': 'Every Time We Say Goodbye (Jane Austen Society, #3)', 'webUrl': 'https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/195791123-every-time-we-say-goodbye', '__typename': 'Book', 'viewerShelving': None, 'primaryContributorEdge': {'node': {'id': 'kca://author/amzn1.gr.author.v1.447IJcgr12kxfOcf0cVc8Q', 'name': 'Natalie Jenner', 'webUrl': 'https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/18786953.Natalie_Jenner', 'isGrAuthor': True, '__typename': 'Contributor'}, 'role': 'Author', '__typename': 'BookContributorEdge'}, 'secondaryContributorEdges': [], 'work': {'stats': {'ratingsCount': 262, 'textReviewsCount': 176, 'averageRating': 3.81, '__typename': 'BookOrWorkStats'}, 'id': 'kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v3.u2INeBT8RHQItJyK', 'viewerShelvings': None, '__typename': 'Work', 'editions': {'webUrl': 'https://www.goodreads.com/work/editions/144326616', '__typename': 'BooksConnection'}, 'viewerShelvingsUrl': '/review/user_works/144326616'}, 'reviewEditUrl': 'https://www.goodreads.com/review/edit/195791123'}, '__typename': 'TopListBookEdge'}, {'rank': 96, 'count': 12468, 'node': {'id': 'kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v3.Eid0FDNap6bg5lft', 'legacyId': 195790694, 'imageUrl': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1696802329i/195790694.jpg', 'description': \"<b>When her mother goes missing, a young woman uncovers the secrets beneath her protected community.</b><br /><br /><i>The women asked: How are they safe?<br /><br />And Tamsen Nightingale said: In this red grove, no woman can be harmed.

But that dream has remained stubbornly out of reach, and between Molly’s first job as a barista, her second at a call center, and her crushing student loans, it seems farther away than ever. The absolute last thing she needs is to inherit a run-down, struggling horse barn, courtesy of her estranged late aunt.<br /><br />Molly is so ill-equipped to run the barn, it’s laughable. She certainly doesn’t know how to save it, no matter how much faith everyone who loved her aunt has that she will. But maybe her aunt left Molly a blessing in disguise—if she can sell the land, the profits could be the small-business seed money miracle she’s been waiting for. Doesn’t matter if she’s starting to love the mismatched family this barn brought together, and feeling closer to the aunt she never got a chance to know.<br /><br />The real snag in her plan is the woman who took care of Molly’s aunt in her last days, and still lives and works on the property as a farrier: Shani. Judgmental, grouchy Shani, who thinks she’s so morally superior because she hasn’t given up on the crumbling barn while Molly wants to “destroy” everything her aunt built; who’s really good with the horses, and always comes whenever Molly calls her in a panic; and is actually kind of thoughtful, and obnoxiously hot, and unfailingly loyal…and oh no, has Shani become an entirely different kind of problem?

They are written with buoyant zest and are tautly plotted . . . and are embellished with the rich details of a Dickens or Pratchett.” —The Independent<br /><br />Welcome to Chromatacia, where the societal hierarchy is strictly regulated by one's limited color perception. Civilization has been rebuilt after an unspoken “Something that Happened” five hundred years ago. Society is now color vision-segregated, professions, marriages, and leisure activities all dictated by an individual’s visual ability, and everything run by the shadowy National Color in far-off Emerald City.<br /><br />Out on the fringes of Red Sector West, twenty-year-old Eddie Russett is being bullied into an arranged marriage with the powerful DeMauve family, purples who hope to redden up their progeny’s color-viewing potential with Eddie’s gene stock. Their obnoxious daughter Violet is confident the marriage won’t hamper her style for too long because Eddie is about to go on trial for a murder he didn’t commit, and he’s pretty sure to be sent on a one-way trip to the Green Room for execution by soporific color exposure. Meanwhile, Eddie is engaged in an illegal relationship with his co-defendant, a Green, the charismatic, unpredictable, and occasionally deadly Jane Grey. Time is running out for Eddie and Jane to figure out how to save themselves. Negotiating the narrow boundaries of the Rules within their society, they search for a loophole—some truth of their world that has been hidden from its hyper-policed citizens. <br /><br />New York Times bestselling author Jasper Fforde returns to his fan-favorite Shades of Grey series with this wildly anticipated, laugh-out-loud funny and darkly satiric adventure about two star-crossed lovers on a quest to survive—even if it means upending their entire society in the process.\", 'title': 'Red Side Story', 'titleComplete': 'Red Side Story (Shades of Grey, #2)', 'webUrl': 'https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/199353348-red-side-story', '__typename': 'Book', 'viewerShelving': None, 'primaryContributorEdge': {'node': {'id': 'kca://author/amzn1.gr.author.v1.prVOqpNVvyD3TrxbFzrubQ', 'name': 'Jasper Fforde', 'webUrl': 'https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4432.Jasper_Fforde', 'isGrAuthor': True, '__typename': 'Contributor'}, 'role': 'Author', '__typename': 'BookContributorEdge'}, 'secondaryContributorEdges': [], 'work': {'stats': {'ratingsCount': 1483, 'textReviewsCount': 298, 'averageRating': 4.57, '__typename': 'BookOrWorkStats'}, 'id': 'kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.93c67RyuJlaTnfjys5u7ig', 'viewerShelvings': None, '__typename': 'Work', 'editions': {'webUrl': 'https://www.goodreads.com/work/editions/15320249', '__typename': 'BooksConnection'}, 'viewerShelvingsUrl': '/review/user_works/15320249'}, 'reviewEditUrl': 'https://www.goodreads.com/review/edit/199353348'}, '__typename': 'TopListBookEdge'}, {'rank': 103, 'count': 11940, 'node': {'id': 'kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v3.tVE2gsoK-QSdDpuR', 'legacyId': 177772570, 'imageUrl': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1697739831i/177772570.jpg', 'description': '<b>A dazzling and ambitious debut novel that follows a cosmopolitan Shanghai household backward in time—beginning in 2040 and moving through our present and the recent past—exploring their secrets, their losses, and the ways a family makes and remakes itself across the years.</b><br /><br />2040: Wealthy real estate investor Leo Yang—handsome, distinguished, a real Shanghai man—is on the train back to the city after seeing his family off at the airport.

Jessica Shattuck captures and connects it all—the imperial ambitions of the postwar generation, the rebellion of their offspring in the Sixties, and the fallout we’re still sifting through today. . . . This is a wide-ranging novel to savor.” — TOM PERROTTA<br /><br />From the <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of <em>The Women in the Castle</em> comes a sweeping story of a nation on the rise, and one family’s deeply complicated relationship to the resource that built their fortune and fueled their greatest tragedy, perfect for fans of <em>The Dutch House</em> and <em>Great Circle.</em></strong><br /><br />It’s 1953, and for Nick Taylor, WWII veteran turned company lawyer, oil is the key to the future. He takes the train into the city for work and returns to the peaceful streets of the suburbs and to his wife, Bet, former codebreaker now housewife, and their two children, Katherine and Harry. Nick comes from humble origins but thanks to his work for American Oil, he can provide every comfort for his family, including Last House, a secluded country escape. Deep in the Vermont mountains, the Taylors are free from the stresses of modern life. Bet doesn’t have to worry about the Russian H-bombs that haunt her dreams, and the children roam free in the woods. Last House is a place that could survive the end of the world.<br /><br />It’s 1968, and America is on the brink of change. Protestors fill the streets to challenge everything from the Vietnam War to racism in the wake of MLK’s shooting—to the country\\'s reliance on Big Oil. As Katherine makes her first forays into adult life, she’s caught up in the current of the time and struggles to reconcile her ideals with the stable and privileged childhood her Greatest Generation parents worked so hard to provide. But when the Movement shifts in a more radical direction, each member of the Taylor family will be forced to reckon with the consequences of the choices they’ve made for the causes they believed in.<br /><br />Spanning multiple generations and nearly eighty years, <em>Last House</em> tells the story of one American family during an age of grand ideals and even greater downfalls. Set against the backdrop of our nation’s history, this is an emotional tour de force that digs deeply into questions of inheritance and what we owe each other—and captures to stunning effect the gravity of time, the double edge of progress, and the hubris of empire.', 'title': 'Last House', 'titleComplete': 'Last House', 'webUrl': 'https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/196774466-last-house', '__typename': 'Book', 'viewerShelving': None, 'primaryContributorEdge': {'node': {'id': 'kca://author/amzn1.gr.author.v1.EbfXMQg0ur3TPoRnULQE8Q', 'name': 'Jessica Shattuck', 'webUrl': 'https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/70916.Jessica_Shattuck', 'isGrAuthor': True, '__typename': 'Contributor'}, 'role': 'Author', '__typename': 'BookContributorEdge'}, 'secondaryContributorEdges': [], 'work': {'stats': {'ratingsCount': 168, 'textReviewsCount': 106, 'averageRating': 3.84, '__typename': 'BookOrWorkStats'}, 'id': 'kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v3.4JIKv0NsparpL7y8', 'viewerShelvings': None, '__typename': 'Work', 'editions': {'webUrl': 'https://www.goodreads.com/work/editions/199053659', '__typename': 'BooksConnection'}, 'viewerShelvingsUrl': '/review/user_works/199053659'}, 'reviewEditUrl': 'https://www.goodreads.com/review/edit/196774466'}, '__typename': 'TopListBookEdge'}, {'rank': 106, 'count': 11465, 'node': {'id': 'kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v3.oZ88W8U6_xrwGvVB', 'legacyId': 199797969, 'imageUrl': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1701118703i/199797969.jpg', 'description': 'A bestselling thriller author arranges a luxury train trip that is not what it appears to be in this electrifying modern homage to Agatha Christie from the author of the “tense and twisty” (Julie Clark, New York Times bestselling author) The Chateau .<br /><br />Reclusive, mysterious author Ginevra Ex is famous for her unusual approach to crafting her big bestselling she hires real people and conducts intensive interviews, then fictionalizes them.

When her beloved cousin was murdered just as both girls were entering adulthood, Dancyger felt a new urgency in her devotion to the women in her life—a desire to hold her friends close while she still could. In First Love, this urgency runs through a striking exploration of the bonds between women, from the intensity of adolescent best friendship and fluid sexuality to mothering and chosen family.<br /><br />Each essay in this incisive collection is grounded in a close female friendship in Dancyger’s life, reaching outward to dissect cultural assumptions about identity and desire, and the many ways women create space for each other in a world that wants us small. Seamlessly weaving personal experience with literature and pop culture—ranging from fairytales to true crime, from Anaïs Nin and Sylvia Plath to Heavenly Creatures and the “sad girls” of Tumblr—Dancyger’s essays form a kaleidoscopic story of a life told through friendships, and an expansive interrogation of what it means to love each other.<br /><br />Though friendship will never be enough to keep us safe from the dangers of the world, Dancyger reminds us that love is always worth the risk, and that when tragedy strikes, it’s our friends who will help us survive.

When Kit’s best friend gets dumped by his boyfriend, he begs her to ditch her family responsibilities for an idyllic weekend in the Montana mountains. They’ll soak in hot springs, then sneak a vape into a dive bar and drink too much, like old times. Instead, their getaway only reminds Kit of everything she’s lost lately: her wildness, her independence, and—most heartbreaking of all—her sister, Julie, who died a few years ago.<br /><br />When she returns to the Dallas suburbs, Kit tries to settle into her routine—long afternoons spent caring for her irrepressible daughter, going on therapist-advised dates with her concerned husband, and reluctantly taking her mother’s phone calls. But in the secret recesses of Kit’s mind, she’s reminiscing about the band she used to be in—and how they’d go out to the desert after shows and drop acid. She’s imagining an impossible threesome with her kid’s pretty gymnastics teacher and the cool playground mom. Keyed into everything that might distract from her surfacing pain, Kit spirals.

Chung, based on her family story<br /><br />Daughters are the Ang family’s curse.<br /><br />In 1948, civil war ravages the Chinese countryside, but in rural Shandong, the wealthy, landowning Angs are more concerned with their lack of an heir. Hai is the eldest of four girls and spends her days looking after her sisters. Headstrong Di, who is just a year younger, learns to hide in plain sight, and their mother—abused by the family for failing to birth a boy—finds her own small acts of rebellion in the kitchen. As the Communist army closes in on their town, the rest of the prosperous household flees, leaving behind the girls and their mother because they view them as useless mouths to feed.<br /><br />Without an Ang male to punish, the land-seizing cadres choose Hai, as the eldest child, to stand trial for her family’s crimes. She barely survives their brutality. Realizing the worst is yet to come, the women plan their escape. Starving and penniless but resourceful, they forge travel permits and embark on a thousand-mile journey to confront the family that abandoned them.<br /><br />From the countryside to the bustling city of Qingdao, and onward to British Hong Kong and eventually Taiwan, they witness the changing tide of a nation and the plight of multitudes caught in the wake of revolution. But with the loss of their home and the life they’ve known also comes new freedom—to take hold of their fate, to shake free of the bonds of their gender, and to claim their own story.<br /><br />Told in assured, evocative prose, with impeccably drawn characters, Daughters of Shandong is a hopeful, powerful story about the resilience of women in war; the enduring love between mothers, daughters, and sisters; and the sacrifices made to lift up future generations.', 'title': 'Daughters of Shandong', 'titleComplete': 'Daughters of Shandong', 'webUrl': 'https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/195888874-daughters-of-shandong', '__typename': 'Book', 'viewerShelving': None, 'primaryContributorEdge': {'node': {'id': 'kca://author/amzn1.gr.author.v3.rb2KtCi9WwpaOt_h', 'name': 'Eve J.

A red canoe sits abandoned on Seymour Rock, right where the Saugatuck River hits the Long Island Sound. The elegantly dressed corpse of a woman lies inside…. It’s been two years since Nora Carleton left the job she loved at the US Attorney’s Office to become lead counsel at Saugatuck Associates, the world’s largest hedge fund. The career change also meant a change of scenery, relocating her to Westport, Connecticut, fifty miles north of New York City. But it was worth it to get her daughter, Sophie, away from the city. Plus, she likes the people she works with. Especially Helen, who recruited Nora because of her skills as an investigator. Helen is certain that someone inside of Saugatuck is using the company’s secrets for their own advantage, undercutting Saugatuck’s investments and putting the company’s reputation at risk. So when Helen is brutally murdered, Nora suspects she may have gotten too close to an employee with something to hide. What Nora doesn’t anticipate is that she is about to become the prime suspect in the investigation into Helen’s death. Nora calls in her old colleagues from the US Attorney’s Office, Mafia investigator Benny Dugan and attorney Carmen Garcia. To clear Nora’s name, Benny and Carmen hunt for the evidence that Helen must have found before she died, damning enough to push her killer into action. Instead, they find that Helen carried secrets on every member of the firm and all of them had motive enough to murder. And as Benny sets out to interrogate the team at Saugatuck, Nora examines her history with the company to determine who set her up to take the fall. A suspenseful and intriguing tale of high finance and murder, Westport is the thrilling follow-up to Central Park West , continuing the saga of Nora Carleton and her investigative team.

But where did this transformative voice come from?<br /><br />In <i>Rebel Girl</i>, Hanna’s raw and insightful new memoir, she takes us from her tumul\\xadtuous childhood to her formative college years and her first shows. As Hanna makes clear, being in a punk “girl band” in those years was not a simple or safe prospect. Male violence and antagonism threatened at every turn, and surviving as a singer who was a lightning rod for controversy took limitless amounts of determination.<br /><br />But the relationships she developed during those years buoyed her, including with her bandmates Tobi Vail, Kathi Wilcox, JD Samson, and Johanna Fateman. And her friendships with musicians like Kurt Cobain, Ian MacKaye, Kim Gordon, and Joan Jett reminded her that, despite the odds, the punk world could still nurture and care for its own. Hanna opens up about falling in love with Ad-Rock of the Beastie Boys and her debilitating battle with Lyme disease, and she brings us behind the scenes of her musical growth in her bands Le Tigre and The Julie Ruin. She also writes candidly about the Riot Grrrl movement, documenting with love its grassroots origins but critiquing its exclusivity.<br /><br />In an uncut voice all her own, Hanna reveals the hardest times along with the most joyful—and how they continue to fuel her revolutionary art and music.', 'title': 'Rebel Girl: My Life as a Feminist Punk', 'titleComplete': 'Rebel Girl: My Life as a Feminist Punk', 'webUrl': 'https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/78130090-rebel-girl', '__typename': 'Book', 'viewerShelving': None, 'primaryContributorEdge': {'node': {'id': 'kca://author/amzn1.gr.author.v1.KO501203Pkiz1_HAGuIThg', 'name': 'Kathleen Hanna', 'webUrl': 'https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1026442.Kathleen_Hanna', 'isGrAuthor': False, '__typename': 'Contributor'}, 'role': 'Author', '__typename': 'BookContributorEdge'}, 'secondaryContributorEdges': [], 'work': {'stats': {'ratingsCount': 58, 'textReviewsCount': 22, 'averageRating': 4.47, '__typename': 'BookOrWorkStats'}, 'id': 'kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v3.UfGoAxF8VBjwgIh6', 'viewerShelvings': None, '__typename': 'Work', 'editions': {'webUrl': 'https://www.goodreads.com/work/editions/103344774', '__typename': 'BooksConnection'}, 'viewerShelvingsUrl': '/review/user_works/103344774'}, 'reviewEditUrl': 'https://www.goodreads.com/review/edit/78130090'}, '__typename': 'TopListBookEdge'}, {'rank': 133, 'count': 9869, 'node': {'id': 'kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v3.OkG0KmoSp1VUYv9K', 'legacyId': 195791340, 'imageUrl': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1695221795i/195791340.jpg', 'description': \"Kill the dragon.

Teaming with his fearless daughter (now a civil rights lawyer) and a former Black Panther who spent most of his life in Parchman Prison, Penn tears into Bobby White’s pursuit of the Presidency and ultimately risks a second Civil War to try to expose its motivation to the world, before the America of our Constitution slides into the abyss.<br /><br />In Southern Man, Greg Iles returns to the riveting style and historic depth that made the Natchez Burning trilogy a searing masterpiece and hurls the narrative fifteen years forward into our current moment—where America itself teeters on the brink of anarchy.', 'title': 'Southern Man', 'titleComplete': 'Southern Man (Penn Cage, #7)', 'webUrl': 'https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58884700-southern-man', '__typename': 'Book', 'viewerShelving': None, 'primaryContributorEdge': {'node': {'id': 'kca://author/amzn1.gr.author.v1.Re3DH0Iuld6RiXKGp_KPFQ', 'name': 'Greg Iles', 'webUrl': 'https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/19696.Greg_Iles', 'isGrAuthor': True, '__typename': 'Contributor'}, 'role': 'Author', '__typename': 'BookContributorEdge'}, 'secondaryContributorEdges': [], 'work': {'stats': {'ratingsCount': 73, 'textReviewsCount': 43, 'averageRating': 4.33, '__typename': 'BookOrWorkStats'}, 'id': 'kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v3.F2joPCmHitjQcvJ4', 'viewerShelvings': None, '__typename': 'Work', 'editions': {'webUrl': 'https://www.goodreads.com/work/editions/92769443', '__typename': 'BooksConnection'}, 'viewerShelvingsUrl': '/review/user_works/92769443'}, 'reviewEditUrl': 'https://www.goodreads.com/review/edit/58884700'}, '__typename': 'TopListBookEdge'}, {'rank': 139, 'count': 9592, 'node': {'id': 'kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v3.gaWA0tVGUKzpzycp', 'legacyId': 180352002, 'imageUrl': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1687798450l/180352002.jpg', 'description': '<b>Sometimes love means embracing the good, the bad . . . and even the impossible.</b><br /><br />Dear Reader,<br /><br />My name is Luke Edgewood, and there are few things in life that I require. Mainly black coffee. And flannel. And lots of solitude. And my dogs, Chewy and Indie. What I don’t need is romance, so I have no plans to change my thirty-year-old bachelor status anytime soon.<br /><br />But my youngest sister thinks that by accepting a short-term construction job in the small European country of Skymar, I’m going to follow along in her footsteps and discover my own romantic adventure. Nope. Bah humbug. The End. This time, her rom-com-movie senses are totally wrong.<br /><br />Or maybe not. Because I’ve met a Grace Kelly look-alike who is annoying . . . until she isn’t. But she is impossible. As in, nothing can happen between us because she is a literal princess. Even though that’s easy to forget when we’re working together to restore a castle-like orphanage in a secluded mountain town and “forced proximity” includes a small closet, a secret one-hundred-year-old journal, and the tactile memory of an off-limits royal in my arms.<br /><br />Basically, the whole situation has turned into an ooey gooey magical snow globe of romantic tropes complete with cute kids and an actual ball.

But there is a condition attached. Anya must marry before her next birthday if she wants to see any of the fortune. The executor of the will is an insufferably conceited man who must consent to her marriage—if he doesn’t give his consent, the fortune reverts to him. But Damian Ashton is only part of the problem.

They believe the fortune is rightfully theirs, and they will do all in their power—including accusing Anya of murder and Damian of some dubious and criminal dealings—to get their hands on the fortune. Now Anya must do everything she can to thwart their efforts, save herself from the gallows, and at the same time, resist the powerful attraction she feels towards Damian—who surely is only interested in keeping the Budleigh money.

Carelli has written the definitive account of the crime, drawn from hours of interviews with witnesses and family members, painstaking historical research, and most notably, correspondence with the killers themselves. The result is a riveting snapshot of lives rocked by tragedy, and a town left in turmoil. But how much of the story is true? Compulsively readable, provocative, and disturbing, Penance is a cleverly nuanced, unflinching exploration of gender, class, and power that raises troubling questions about the media and our obsession with true crime while bringing to light the depraved side of human nature and our darkest proclivities.\", 'title': 'Penance', 'titleComplete': 'Penance', 'webUrl': 'https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/199531883-penance', '__typename': 'Book', 'viewerShelving': None, 'primaryContributorEdge': {'node': {'id': 'kca://author/amzn1.gr.author.v3.Ialm6ycnuKtqwSBZ', 'name': 'Eliza  Clark', 'webUrl': 'https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/20473391.Eliza_Clark', 'isGrAuthor': False, '__typename': 'Contributor'}, 'role': 'Author', '__typename': 'BookContributorEdge'}, 'secondaryContributorEdges': [], 'work': {'stats': {'ratingsCount': 16191, 'textReviewsCount': 3044, 'averageRating': 3.94, '__typename': 'BookOrWorkStats'}, 'id': 'kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v3.AppZXMgkQX9luX_u', 'viewerShelvings': None, '__typename': 'Work', 'editions': {'webUrl': 'https://www.goodreads.com/work/editions/98706748', '__typename': 'BooksConnection'}, 'viewerShelvingsUrl': '/review/user_works/98706748'}, 'reviewEditUrl': 'https://www.goodreads.com/review/edit/199531883'}, '__typename': 'TopListBookEdge'}, {'rank': 148, 'count': 8694, 'node': {'id': 'kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v3.kzIaI8uCWhDydKiG', 'legacyId': 195888777, 'imageUrl': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1695916331i/195888777.jpg', 'description': '<b>Magnificent Beasts.

It’s said that if the sinful lowers commit themselves to kindness, their souls will lighten, allowing them into the blissful upper realms.<br /><br />But <b>Aina</b>, one of the few lowers to ever ascend, just wants to go back. Desperate to reunite with her mother, who remains stuck in their horror-infested homeland, Aina joins the Balancers—a group that defies Toranic Law by bringing aid to those condemned to a life of suffering in the lower realms.<br /><br />Alongside Aina are two new recruits: <b>Aranel</b>, a spoiled noble spying for the upper authorities; and <b>Meizan</b>, a ruthless fighter trying to save his clan from extinction.<br /><br />Before long, Aina, Aranel, and Meizan find themselves in the midst of a brewing war. On one side, a violent lower king is bent on destroying Toranic Law; on the other, the upper authorities will do anything to stay on top.<br /><br />The trio must face both sides head-on if they want to stop a conflict that could break not only Toranic Law... but the universe itself.<br /><br /><i>\"An exhilarating series opener.\"</i> - Kirkus (Starred Review)', 'title': 'Spin of Fate', 'titleComplete': 'Spin of Fate (The Fifth Realm, #1)', 'webUrl': 'https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/195888777-spin-of-fate', '__typename': 'Book', 'viewerShelving': None, 'primaryContributorEdge': {'node': {'id': 'kca://author/amzn1.gr.author.v3.gozTMFcieRniWisM', 'name': 'A.A.

So no one is more surprised than Cecilia to find herself escaping her own seventieth birthday party to return to the remote but beautiful cottage on Cape Cod—a place filled with memories. Some are good—especially memories of the early days with her husband, volatile artist Cameron, before his fame eclipsed their marriage. But then there are the memories she has revealed to no one. Especially not her daughter, Kristen, who hero-worshipped her father.<br /><br />For aspiring artist Lily, Dune Cottage has been a refuge, albeit an illicit one. After dropping out of medical school, she’s cleaning houses on the Cape to get by, guilt-ridden for disappointing her parents. Unoccupied for years, the cottage seemed the perfect place to hide away and lick her wounds—until Cecilia unexpectedly arrives. Despite an awkward beginning, Lily accepts Cecilia’s invitation to stay on as her guest, and a flicker of kinship ignites.<br /><br />Then Cecilia’s grandson, Todd—and Lily’s unrequited crush—shows up, sending a shock wave through their unlikely friendship.

When fifteen-year-old Ella Fitzgerald’s mother dies at the height of the Depression in 1932, the teenager goes to work for the mob to support herself and her family. When the law finally catches up, the “ungovernable” adolescent is incarcerated in the New York Training School for Girls in upstate New York—a wicked prison infamous for its harsh treatment of inmates, especially Black ones. Determined to be free, Ella escapes and makes her way back to Harlem, where she is forced to dance for pennies on the street. Looking for a break into show business, Ella draws straws to appear at the Apollo Theater’s Amateur Night on November 21, 1934. Rather than perform a dance routine directly after “The World Famous Edwards Sisters” number, the homeless Ella, wearing men’s galoshes a size too big, risks everything when she decides to sing Judy instead. Four years later, at barely twenty-one, Ella Fitzgerald has become the bestselling female vocalist in America. Diane Richards’ Ella Fitzgerald is inspiring and intriguing—an emotionally rich, psychologically complex character, a flawed mother and wife who struggles with deep emotional scars and trauma and battles racism, sexism, and colorism as she learns to find her voice on the stage. Ella takes us from the brothels, speakeasys, and streets of Depression-era New York City to the grand hotel suites where Ella, now older and wiser, looks back on her life and finally confronts the demons from childhood that torment her. Compelling and rich in historical detail, Ella is a remarkable debut novel about an extraordinary woman.', 'title': 'Ella', 'titleComplete': 'Ella', 'webUrl': 'https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/181110001-ella', '__typename': 'Book', 'viewerShelving': None, 'primaryContributorEdge': {'node': {'id': 'kca://author/amzn1.gr.author.v1.koN-EFrS0Ga8bJJGDbirWw', 'name': 'Diane Richards', 'webUrl': 'https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/801658.Diane_Richards', 'isGrAuthor': False, '__typename': 'Contributor'}, 'role': 'Author', '__typename': 'BookContributorEdge'}, 'secondaryContributorEdges': [], 'work': {'stats': {'ratingsCount': 47, 'textReviewsCount': 31, 'averageRating': 4.17, '__typename': 'BookOrWorkStats'}, 'id': 'kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v3.NSOnWFHi3a3ypEfr', 'viewerShelvings': None, '__typename': 'Work', 'editions': {'webUrl': 'https://www.goodreads.com/work/editions/197921394', '__typename': 'BooksConnection'}, 'viewerShelvingsUrl': '/review/user_works/197921394'}, 'reviewEditUrl': 'https://www.goodreads.com/review/edit/181110001'}, '__typename': 'TopListBookEdge'}, {'rank': 163, 'count': 8069, 'node': {'id': 'kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v3.Vfry6BAw3e2W-MZ1', 'legacyId': 195790805, 'imageUrl': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1701812541i/195790805.jpg', 'description': 'New York Times bestselling author Jeff Shaara brings alive the heart-stopping days and nights of the Cuban Missile Crisis in a novel featuring his trademark \"you are there\" immediacy.

If it looks like she’s running away from her soon-to-be-ex Wes and New York City, well, she is. But someone has to take care of things and that’s always been Olivia’s role in the family. After years of financial trouble, someone’s finally bailing them out with a huge offer to buy their beachfront property, which is a good thing, although it means losing the home she grew up in, where her mother died, and where she first met Fred, the love of her life.<br /><br />It’s been five years since the last time things blew up between Olivia and Fred, but much longer since the first time. At this point, Olivia fears it was never meant to be, so there’s no reason to feel butterflies in her stomach at the idea of seeing him again. They’ve already tried, and tried again…and again…but she’s newly single, and she isn’t the same person she was the last time–and Fred has changed, too.<br /><br />This time, things will be different.

With in-depth reporting and more than a few personal adventures, bestselling author Jennifer S. Holland digs into what intelligence really means.<br /><br />Readers will meet a pack of genius dogs, each of whom embodies a particular kind of smarts. Holland spends time with Cat Warren, who trains cadaver dogs, to learn about \"nose intelligence.” To unpack emotional intelligence, she examines an unlikely dog friendship; to unpack task learning ability, she seeks out an agility trainer. She interviews police-dog trainers (volunteering to be attacked by one in the name of science), service-dog trainers, and trainers who rehabilitates \"bad\" dogs. And she gets to know breeds that are considered especially intelligent—border collies, cattle dogs, and German shepherds—to discover whether they are truly \"smarter,\" or just more in tune with humans.<br /><br />In between field experiences, Holland spends time with dogs in a variety of settings—a rescue center, a dog park, a boarding facility— while pondering the lessons they teach us about ourselves. And she’ll pose entrancing philosophical How do we define intelligence in another being? Where do \"instinct\" and \"intelligence\" meet and diverge?<br /><br />Both surprising and heartwarming, this book is one woman’s quest to understand the world’s smartest dogs—and how they got that way.', 'title': 'Dog Smart: Life-Changing Lessons in Canine Intelligence', 'titleComplete': 'Dog Smart: Life-Changing Lessons in Canine Intelligence', 'webUrl': 'https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/197522436-dog-smart', '__typename': 'Book', 'viewerShelving': None, 'primaryContributorEdge': {'node': {'id': 'kca://author/amzn1.gr.author.v1.yD5-snIJsO9am4smXDQmlQ', 'name': 'Jennifer S.

There she is thrust into a strange, cold world of savage shield maidens, tyrannical rulers, and mysterious gods. <br /><br />And there she also finds something unexpected: a kindred spirit.

Ava expects her long-term boyfriend to propose before her trip, but instead of giving her a ring, he suggests they use her time abroad as a “break” before settling down.<br /><br />When James Massini arrives–late–to the airport to pick up Ava as a favor to his aunt and uncle, he’s surprised to find that she’s not a young co-ed, but a fascinating woman approaching thirty with a serious superiority complex and a habit of underestimating him. When she’s assigned to his class as a TA, he becomes determined to prove to her that there is more to life than plans and lists, no matter how hard she fights with him–or how annoyingly charming he finds their banter.<br /><br />Despite the sudden disaster of her life, type A Ava might actually enjoy Italy—if only annoyingly carefree James wasn’t there, too. As Ava reluctantly lets James try to show her a different way of life in Italy, she begins to find beauty in the chaos. Of course, it’s when things begin to make sense again that her past comes storming back.<br /><br />With a humorously relatable protagonist and a rich Italian setting, this debut novel is an escapist treat and a necessary reminder that life doesn’t always care about the plans we’ve made for ourselves.\", 'title': \"Wish You Weren't Here\", 'titleComplete': \"Wish You Weren't Here\", 'webUrl': 'https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/197522400-wish-you-weren-t-here', '__typename': 'Book', 'viewerShelving': None, 'primaryContributorEdge': {'node': {'id': 'kca://author/amzn1.gr.author.v3.YAtdLe9Xm0S2t480', 'name': 'Christy Schillig', 'webUrl': 'https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/43609068.Christy_Schillig', 'isGrAuthor': False, '__typename': 'Contributor'}, 'role': 'Author', '__typename': 'BookContributorEdge'}, 'secondaryContributorEdges': [], 'work': {'stats': {'ratingsCount': 67, 'textReviewsCount': 46, 'averageRating': 4.27, '__typename': 'BookOrWorkStats'}, 'id': 'kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v3.JncG_UZd_8gK2icP', 'viewerShelvings': None, '__typename': 'Work', 'editions': {'webUrl': 'https://www.goodreads.com/work/editions/200152612', '__typename': 'BooksConnection'}, 'viewerShelvingsUrl': '/review/user_works/200152612'}, 'reviewEditUrl': 'https://www.goodreads.com/review/edit/197522400'}, '__typename': 'TopListBookEdge'}, {'rank': 190, 'count': 7129, 'node': {'id': 'kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v3.3GlHIpffpLvPiYug', 'legacyId': 196218537, 'imageUrl': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1703872711i/196218537.jpg', 'description': '<b>In this fun, feisty romp, a celebrity life coach collides with her former mentor as both women struggle with the choices they’ve made, the lives they have now, and the legacy they’ll leave behind.</b><br /><br />Caroline Beckett is living the dream.

And yet the closest he ever came to death was the summer of 2020 while spending a quiet afternoon at the New England home he shared with his wife and two young children. Crippled by abdominal pain, Junger was rushed to the hospital by ambulance. Once there, he began slipping away. As blackness encroached, he was visited by his dead father, inviting Junger to join him. “It’s okay,” his father said. “There’s nothing to be scared of. I’ll take care of you.” That was the last thing Junger remembered until he came to the next day when he was told he had suffered a ruptured aneurysm that he should not have survived.<br /><br />This experience spurred Junger—a confirmed atheist raised by his physicist father to respect the empirical—to undertake a scientific, philosophical, and deeply personal examination of mortality and what happens after we die. How do we begin to process the brutal fact that any of us might perish unexpectedly on what begins as an ordinary day? How do we grapple with phenomena that science may be unable to explain?

She knows more about queer media discourse than her very queer little sister. She even has two queer best friends. There's Gretchen, a fellow high school senior, who helps keep Imogen's biases in check. And then there's Lili—newly out and newly thriving with a cool new squad of queer college friends. Imogen's thrilled for Lili. Any ally would be. And now that she's finally visiting Lili on campus, she's bringing her ally A game. Any support Lili needs, Imogen's all in. Even if that means bending the truth, just a little. Like when Lili drops a tiny queer she's told all her college friends that Imogen and Lili used to date.

The book and each thematic section are brilliantly introduced and contextualized by Susan Wood, a professor at the University of British Columbia and a literary editor and feminist activist during the 1960s and ’70s.<br /><br />A fascinating, intimate look into the exceptional mind of Le Guin whose insights remain as relevant and resonant today as when they were first published.', 'title': 'The Language of the Night: Essays on Writing, Science Fiction, and Fantasy', 'titleComplete': 'The Language of the Night: Essays on Writing, Science Fiction, and Fantasy', 'webUrl': 'https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/199798061-the-language-of-the-night', '__typename': 'Book', 'viewerShelving': None, 'primaryContributorEdge': {'node': {'id': 'kca://author/amzn1.gr.author.v1.DGpGA0Nd52OC10S5I-D3oA', 'name': 'Ursula K.
